## Brief Outline

### What is Bitcoin

Bitcoin is defined by a chain of **transaction**. There does not exist ANY entity that represent "a Bitcoin". One is considered to "own" a bitcoin only because there's a transaction record on the ledger showing that someone has transfer one bitcoin to him.

### What problems are Bitcoin trying to Solve

1. Decentralized Transaction System
2. Anonymous Transaction
3. Temper-evident Ledger
4. Prevent Double-spending

### How Bitcoin solve these problems

There are four main problems the Bitcoin trying to solve:

1. Decentralization - A decentralized transaction system means that there does not exist a "trusted third party" in the system. Everyone joining the network will become a "bank" and maintain the consistency of ledger.
2. Anonymous - With the new privacy model, transactions can be done anonymously while the safety of account can be ensured.
3. Temper-evident - Using the hash function to chain up all the blocks (can be seen as pages of ledger), It will be almost impossible for the attacker to temper the ledger and let all nodes in the network accept the tempered result.
4. Double-spend preventing - By using both the UTXO model and validation process, the Bitcoin will be able to prevent double-spending.
